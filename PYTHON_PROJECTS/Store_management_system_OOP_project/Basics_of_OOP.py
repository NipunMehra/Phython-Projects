class Item:
    pass








# Keyword 'pass' is used to get rid of any errors in place of an empty class body. 

'''
item1 = Item()
notice how string is also a class and the varibale Rondom_str is an object
Similarly item1 
Random_str = str("4")  ----------------------> Random_str = "4" (same as the other)
                        generally written as
'''

'''
item1.name = "Phone"
item1.price = 100
item1.quantity = 5

print(type(item1)) -----------> this will prnit :-  <class '__main__.Item'> {This is how it looks in the terminal}
So, we created an object of class Item i.e. item1 which has its own attributes(name, price, quantity).
